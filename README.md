### Hey, I'm SambhavðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22 year old linux geek & professionally, a backend engineer;

## ðŸ’Ž Experience

I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have a broader hands-on experience with backend & cloud platform development, primarily in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) & [Go](https://go.dev/). However previously, I have focused on technologies like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for frontend, [Java](https://www.java.com/) for Android, [Python](https://www.python.org/) for scripting & deployment, etc;

Following from this, I spent 4 years studying Computer Science & Engineering, specializing on advanced software systems, later on working as a Software Engineer at an electronics firm with industry standard frameworks such as [SystemC / TLM](https://systemc.org/), [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/), customized libraries like SCML, and debugging & performance testing tools like [GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).

My current job envolves ERP cloud based technologies like [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), enhanced by cloud platforms like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
