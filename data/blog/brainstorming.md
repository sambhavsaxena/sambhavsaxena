#### What kind of technologies?

For the past few years, I've worked with technologies like web frontend and UI/UX, cloud computing and docker containers, backend and multi-platform frameworks. What is the idea behind?

#### Ideas behind-

Following are some ideas to grasp the approach of a technology: - Read the documentation: Straightly put, documentation is the most resourceful piece of content you'll find about a technology, as it had been written by the developers of a particular technology themselves. - Go through the errors: During the installation process, or maybe during development initialization, or at any phase of the course of development, you'll find errors that would force you to hit your brain around the web. Trust me, you learn a lot about that technology just by resolving errors. - Take help from community leads: Agreed that it's difficult to contact the leads directly, but you can interact with them on the Github repositories, provided you're working on an open source project. Raise legitimate issues you encounter while experiencing that technology, and how you fixed it. - Small steps, bigger goal: Keep resolving and working for the communities and your contributions increase automatically. You wouldn't even feel like contributing when you help someone through a problem you were stuck with, and the community is always grateful for that. - Documentation and the forums: Tech forums, on Reddit, Discord, Github, Slack, anywhere around on the internet are really helpful. You would find some really smart people chilling around here while helping others out with a problem. These are the people who love what they do(unlike us Indians lmao).

Summing up, you will have a great experience learning new things out of scratch. Especially if you know someone in the community.
Nonetheless, it doesnot matter much, just get started with what makes you think about that shit.

Just get going.
