#### What happened on 25th May, 2020?
George Floyd, a black native American was brutally murdered by white police officers in Dallas, Texas. The police officers held responsible for the murder were set free of all the charges against them, even after committing a non-bailable offense, Events after which lead to the BLM movement across the globe.

So I was reading the whole case and went on reading more about discrimination and human rights. This time not on inclined and curropt news websites, but on National Geographic, got to the roots of this issue, roughly called the _Philosophy of Human Variations_.

#### Philosophy
The study of the fundamental nature o knowledge, reality and existance, when considered in the context of the academics, is what the web says.

#### What happening in India?
Well okay, do you know about the SC Act of the IPC(Indian Penal Code)? The SC Act of the IPC is a law that was passed by the Supreme Court, which states that calling a person belonging to a lower caste or race is a punishable CRIME, and the VICTIM will have the authorise the name that seems satisfactory in their perspective. 

But the fact is, nobody has the right to call anyone inferior. But, in today's world of equality, people find being called to the caste or creed they belong to UNJUST and the law stands absolutely true and necessary. While philosophically, it seems to ruin the significance of natural human variation and originality.

Like for example, let's say there's this man who is involved in a less significant job, why should he fight against people rather than accepting what he really do? This might trigger some I know that well, but philosophy says what's written in the definition above. What's the logic of hiding what you really are? Instead people should accept the way they are and should live with it. Instead they revolt against it frequently causing unnecessary chaos. Why are people indiscreet to call themselves what they really are? Remember that variation is a human trait and people cannot be united however hard anyone might try, all of us ARE and WILL ALWAYS BE different, being what, is philosophically correct but socially wrong.
