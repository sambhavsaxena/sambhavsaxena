#### What is Religion?

Religion is usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements.

#### Prequal
The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries. Ancient sacred texts like the Bible, the Quran, and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written
First, the Moon passes well north of the umbra's center with its northern limb nearly tangent to the umbra's edge. Minutes after it enters the shadow, it pushes out the other side.

The word religion as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages.

#### The birth tale-
I would like to introduce y'all these traits of human behaviour:
- Every human has the tendency to differentiate himself\herself\themselves from each other.
As already proved by different experiments over several years, even twins have different personalities. And it's not just about twins, even if a human is born at the exact same time as some other human, having same parents, and literally the same DNA, they will still have the tendency to be different by their thoughts and ideas.

- Every human has the tendency to believe in someone superior to himself\herself\themselves.
Be it a person, a boss, a God, or any literal entity in the universe, all of us have the tendency to believe in something superior to us. Also proved by studies conducted at Oxford University, which proves out to be entirely true on this basis.

It is the combined effect of these two traits that we, as humans, gave birth to religion.

We follow a leader, and we think that we're different from people who follow some other leader. This is something that didn't exist before, and that we have to learn to live with.

And that is how a religion is made. Not by books or history, but by human behavior.

The religion I follow, Hinduism, has no definition for religon. It explains Karma as the only decisive factor for what defines everything else.

Here's a link to the longest epic poem ever written, with means that define humanity-
