#### What is golden hour?

When you google this term, you'll get [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/5odlY52u43F5BjByhxg7wg) mesmerising song by [JVKE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/164Uj4eKjl6zTBKfJLFKKK). But in photography, the golden hour is the period of daytime shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky. The golden hour is also sometimes called the "magic hour," especially by cinematographers and photographers. This is what wikipedia says. I have a rather different perspective to definition of golden hour.

Speaking of my travel ventures in other blog posts like [this](https://interpreted.vercel.app/blog/mountain-man), you might have come across a term as a moment being `once in  a lifetime experience`. Golden hour, in my terms, is an extended version to this.

Now, talking about golden hours, I hope to see many more of them in the next few years, but mentioning that it is one of the best moments to capture in everyone's life, and has a psychological connection to major changes that takes place when some major event occurs. But could it be more spiritual as well? I think so.

Although reading extensively about other worlds, about psychology and human mind, about fears and desires, about the universe and the stars, about the past and the future, about the present and the moment, I have come to a conclusion that the golden hour is the best time to introspect. It is the best time to think about the people you love, the people you hate, the people you want to be with. Makes me wonder that there exists a third person view of the story, the `spiritual view`, so to speak. Might be the case that many people may discard as being irrational, but on a personal level, I think it is the best time to connect with the universe, and to connect with yourself.

Whenever you encounter one such event, remember to take a deep breath and address yourself in this wabi-sabi. Take a moment to notice and appreciate life.

To be more of a human.
