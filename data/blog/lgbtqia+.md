#### How dare you?!

Greta Thunberg much, well, I don't have a problem as long as anything doesn't affect my country and its people. But now it has started to matter. I've seen for years witnessing myself, and I've read enough of the history to figure out that India has a very wide ranging effects of whatever changes takes place in the west. If you look at the history, it was the west which started all the chaos on minorities back in the 14th century, of which India still stays sympathetic. But there are people from the west blaming the Indian government of exploiting the minorities of the country. And not just from the west, mind you, it wasn't much of a problem while the outsiders spit shit about us, now people of Indian origin have this in their mindset, that India exploits her minorities?

Here's what India has done to promote for well being of the minorities:

    - The world hated Jews, India welcomes them and provides them land to prosper, identity to live, travel with as much rights as any Indian has, practice and promote their religion without bounds, and a lot more. India has Jewish restaurants where even Indians are not allowed. Only Israelis visit these restaurants, and any other minority is free to do so. It's racist against Indians tbh, but still allowed. [See](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-cafe-in-india-said-to-only-serve-white-customers/)?
    - Minorities have their own religious institutions, with reservations for people of their cult, tax free from the government, plus some benefits for religious promotions. These include some very prominent institutes of the country, the [Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in/), [JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), colleges of Delhi University including [SGTB Khalsa](https://sgtbkhalsadu.ac.in/), [St. Stephens College](https://www.ststephens.edu/), my alma-mater being an Orthodox school. 
    - There is freedom to practice religion on public places, people sometimes block roads and important routes of the national capital on religious occasions, the national police to safegaurds them from any mishap, ordered by the Indian government. Talking about our Islam counterpart, people of Pakistan don't enjoy these benefits in their very own Islamic state.
    - The population percentage of Hindus in India has been declining for the past few decades, while a minority religion (which isn't much of a minority, accounts for over 19% of the population, 172.66 million people identifying as adherents of Islam, still enjoys benefits of minorities), has been rising for the last decade. Whereas in Pakistan, Hindu population declined from being 12% to just 1.8%, 50 years post independence.

And similarly, even though India treats her minorities so well, funded organizations from the west reports on how people are devastated in India just because they are minorities, and this thought has now begun to implant in people's mind. THIS is one of the problem.

#### What's the matter with giving people right to choose their sexual orientation?

Because......it's not something that has to be chosen!  When a person is born, is biologically evident that he/she is a guy/girl. Or they might even be a biological bisexual which is absolutely valid. But what's the need to choose your own personal gender? 

This issue is becoming more psychological than social. People try to fuck anything and make a gender out of themselves on the basis of things they fuck, like bruv you're not gay, you're sick. Suppose being raised by two men, or two women, or two people who were men and are now women, or all other illogical sexual orientations, based on what they feel to be. I am a straight man, now I would like myself to be identified as a lesbian woman. How would that be?

There exists just three genders based on a child's biological orientation, and all the other genders are nothing more than a virus. Stop ruining the country. A war with straight russian men will crush you beyond revival. They would not just kill your men, but also fuck them because they deserve that. And people in India are openly accepting this mishap, as if they are okay to fuck a fruit and call themselves pomoriented-trans-psychomasculine-eunuch?

Come on Indians, that's not what the 4 Vedas wrote about your bloodline, or 108 Upanishads, or 18 Puranas, or the epic like Mahabharat and Ramayan, stand up to be a masculine man, you have to take the Indian society forward!

People keep calling me homophobic, people who blindly follow the west, people who know bullshit about nothing, people who think its cool to be fucked by another man. So be it, I am a homophobic but I won't accept a degrading Indian society as long as I am alive.

What do you think is the reason behind rise of gay population in the west? Were there not as many gay people always? The reason is, you look at the west, you think it's cool, you follow them blindly, and you lay in bed with another man lmao. 


Think broad brothers.
