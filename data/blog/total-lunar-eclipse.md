#### As it was seen?
If it feels like a while since the Moon took a deep dive into Earth's shadow, you're right. The last total lunar eclipse occurred on January 21, 2019, followed by four penumbral eclipses in 2020. Wait no more!

#### Phases-
On May 26th, observers in the western half of North America, Northern India, western South America, East Asia, and Australia will once again see the Moon fully eclipsed. This eclipse will be short and sweet much like the total solar variety, with the Moon spending just 15.9 minutes inside the umbra, Earth's central shadow. The brief visit is due to two factors.

First, the Moon passes well north of the umbra's center with its northern limb nearly tangent to the umbra's edge. Minutes after it enters the shadow, it pushes out the other side.

And second, the Moon passes east of the scorpion's hand the north pole visible at the center of the shadow it casts.

The Moon will also be traveling faster along its orbit. On May 11th when it was at apogee, its most distant point from the Earth, it clocked in at 3,528 kilometers per hour (2,192 mph). During totality on the 26th, our satellite will be sailing along almost 250 kilometers an hour (155 mph) faster. The extra speed hastens its exit from the shadow. 

Moon was lovely. As it had always been.
