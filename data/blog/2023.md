### The timeline

In the previous blog post, I wrote about how hard has the recession hit the world. It was a tough time for everyone (and still is). But, the world has changed a lot since then. The economy is back on track, and the world is moving forward. Last week, I saw a LinkedIn post about Google laying off 30,000 more employees by the year end. No big deal they did it. But let's not talk about all that shit once again.

Right from the beginning of 2023, I had my semester exams almost over thinking about when will I -

</center>

But then, I was also surfing over [r/MapPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/) to keep myself distracted. Spent over 2 hours each day to consume internet. And consume what? Facts? Weird stories? Travel Experiences? Latest technologies? Yes. All. of. that.

</center>

Alright, but in reality, everything revolved around a very few people. I used to talk to Mom, Dad, a few friends, Ishaan, that was all. Did very little Leetcode, didn't give contests, no open source contributions of the time around Jan-Feb.

I was busy taking care of tiger:

While others missed your man's attention:

While your man was off to CIPET to have some tea after exams got over (I don't smoke):

</center>

Also, read more about international affairs (I still do):

Later on, around mid of that year, I started to gain momentum:

</center>

Until I started to mention my goals to travel full time (delusional):

Got one of my friend's video viral, but let's not talk about that time for now. By this time, it was already:

Then we went to Mandi, planning about our very own community as well, but that's a story for another day:

Went swimming every week:
