#### What's with the title?

It's an international best-seller by `Thomas Erikson`. It talks about how people you are around makes up what you think about, your personality and attributes. Recently read and got inspired by the ideology that the protagonist follows. Hence the title.

#### So what are you going to talk about now?

Very random, but I wish to share a personal experience within the corporate world as a starter:

I had started my internship at some electronics startup based out of Bengaluru, and mind you that was the best offer I could secure on-campus, being shortlisted from a few companies that visited.
