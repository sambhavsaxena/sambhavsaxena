#### Why did I chose to work in HTML for my portfolio even after having sophisticated knowledge in Javascript frameworks?

Javascript, as you might be knowing already, is a scripting language. It is used to create interactive web pages and web applications involving extensive engineering and logic. Think of huge organizations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and even independent communities working on huge codebases. Now think of an organization handling the control over these codebases, Github? The entire version control logic of Github is largely written in Javascript and Typescript (a superset of JS), while the frontend is written in Electron.Js, which itself is a Javascript framework. 

This is the use of Javascript, to implement high logic control system beneath a layer of what is visible to users. Now coming to this website, my portfolio, which is an entirely single HTML page webpage, there was no need of logic behind it.

Simply saying, _The quantity of information was more than the quantity of logic_.

Sarcastically as [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) said:

_**Any program that can be written in JS will eventually be written in JS**_

While in logic oriented websites, the weight of engineering performed is way more than the information they share. So, Javascript is obviously suitable for them. Transmitting knowledge and content does not require an entire course of engineering implemeted behind a simple website. It might be used if a person is trying to show his/her skills by designing the website using logic. No matter what, Javascript is a very good choice for this particular purpose.
