_Welcome to the 21st century, where sex is free and love expensive. Where loosing a phone is more painful than loosing virginity, where modernization means nudity, where if you don't smoke or drink, you're out of fashion, where if you don't cheat on your partner, you're out of love, or not clever enough, where the bathrooms have become photo studios, temples, dating spots, where to worship God is difficult, where lies become reality, where women fear pregnancy more than STDs, where pizza delivery is faster than an emergency response, where perspective and drip decides the value of a person, where boys are afraid of marriage but love having sex, where whoever plays the mind always gets the happiness, but whoever thinks with the heart gets hurt, where modernity, lust and liquid education is the new generation of HUMANITY._
