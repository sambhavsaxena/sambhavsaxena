Agh! Too long since I last wrote a line of blog instead of a line of code using my keyboard. I'm still wondering what took me so long, since mid 2024 to now 2026. Follow along and we might know.

Mostly its everyday jargon but all of that adds up to more stable trajectory which when expanded on a long term scale, would also presumably give you an exponent scale graph for the life events I encounter. Zoom in to other blogs just like you do while trading on a screener chart 😭

Then we'll get along with talking about what I meant when I say that boring is better.


### Catching up from the past
While I wrote `Surrounded by Idiots`, I had recently made a switch from one hell of toxicity. So last blog was probably a vent out for that. But with time it unfolded that it wasn't even that bad. I mean just try to look from the owner's POV. If I were in his place, I would have done the same thing (except being too stingy). I would have wanted my employees to work near 12 hours, I would have tried to optimize on costs, achieve profitability as soon and squeeze margins. Now with time, those people got an acquisition offer from an established firm and the employees' paycheck doubled. Which means that at one point of time, people who stayed in the company made more money than those who left for better pay. Had I been in the same organization, I would have made more money in 2024 (yes I track income yearly basis). Plus, thanks to advent of AI, the semiconductor industry is exploding with opportunities, and all the big tech want these guys to write and prototype hardwarephilic scripts.

Later 2025, I had a call with one of these guys, a close friend of mine, who had a manager from Microsoft call him up to stay in the project. I had mixed feelings personally speaking. I mean had I stayed in the same company, I wouldn't have just made the same amount of money (was true until last year), I would have better connections in the industry and better exit options (big tech).

But then, grass is always greener on the other side. I wouldn't have liked what I did day in day out. So it was better (and important) that I made that call. Because as a consequence of that switch, I not only started getting experience of a good piece of software, but also I was able to get more exposure to high-end production grade application development and an environment that helped me grow my skills (and paycheck) the following year.

After all of that, I made one more hop, September 2025, now working in a team with the best in class devs, following best in class industry practices, serving US clients as an IC, where everyday is a new learning in a new domain, from finance to lending, to communication to scalibility, everything.

And being an IC is a level up in itself. You'll see why the best of managers have a pay range of 20-40L (big tech don't outsource management), but the best IC dev could have a single 200k USD paycheck, translating to what 1.8Cr?

So that's that.

### Do boring sh*t
You know what happens when you meditate? If you ever try or have tried, you will know that meditation trains you to live in the moment. But why do we need to live in the moment?

Now, let's talking logic. My favourite part.

You spend 2 hours scrolling reels, shorts, or some bullshit news about some actor, influencer, whatever VS you spend 2 hours with yourself.

What would feel better? If its the first one, you're already under influence of severe brainrot. Because, anthropologically, your brain is not designed to consume so much at once because then you end up loosing track of what's important and what's not.

> News is to brain what sugar is to body.

In 10,000 BC, when a nomadic man hunted a bear, it used to be the talk of the town for weeks. And that used to happen rarely even once in a lifetime for some clans. The same clan wouldn't have no idea if someone from the neighboring clan even hunted a lion. Now the thrill from these lion hunting stories is in your hands, that Bali vacation of a friend showing you how beautiful the destination is, or that celebrity's wedding that gives you chills, or some kind of validation that you're trying to seek so hard. Now, the validation is here without you even getting up from your bed. Among that validation, you would also have a band of ads coming your way. There's your chance to make that validation a reality.

All these big tech LLCs right, they're trying to capture your time. So that they can show you and influence you with things of nature that you personally like the best. Then sell you exactly where you'd like to spend your money on. If you're in your 20s, your mind will struggle to fight the algorithms built to keep your focus far from your control, so you're literally fighting the world's most capable most sophosticated team of decision makers with billions of dollars liquid.

So when you meditate, you not only keep your time to yourself instead of selling it to companies, but also keep your money to yourself rather than buying ad-promoted products. Same applies for everything else. You get the point? Boring is better. It will help you sustain your skills in the long run, and save money, and lead a fulfilling life. What else does a man want?

### What's more to AI?

When you write a prompt on [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) to get your work done, you get almost the same amount of thrill that you would have gotten, had you built the same website with your hands, designing it with precision, writing good CSS, optimizing logic, which would have taken days. The same thrill is delivered by AI in minutes, let alone hours. That's exactly why its the supposedly next big thing. OpenAI already announced Ads on free tier, and thats just the start. With the amount of money required to achieve good results from AI, its just not comparable to what a human would do. So to sustain, ads is the only way to go. Because ain't nobody paying those bucks to get bullsh*t completions slop in return.

Tech jobs? This image sums it up.

We all know that no horses drove cars ever. The point being, if you continue to code, or more explicitly, if syntax writing is what you do, then AI is probably going to take your job away. You have to be atleast one level above writing just code in order to survive the apocalypse. Which takes us back to step one. Get your basics right, get good experience and be reliable to the team.

Do boring shit to get along with anything and everything.
